# Privacy Policy for Elvanto Live Plus Plus

**Last Updated: April 25, 2025**

Elvanto Live Plus Plus is a Chrome extension designed to enhance the Elvanto Live platform (https://*.elvanto.com.au/live/*) with features like a "Refresh" button, a "Last refresh" timestamp, chat mention notifications, and customizable chat commands. This Privacy Policy explains how the extension handles data. We prioritize your privacy and do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

## Data We Collect

**No Data Collection**: Elvanto Live Plus Plus does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or usage data. All processing occurs locally on your device.

## How We Use Data

The extension operates entirely on your device, using the following local processes:

- **DOM Manipulation**: The extension modifies Elvanto Live pages to add features like a "Refresh" button, a "Last refresh" timestamp, and highlighted chat mentions. These changes are temporary and limited to the browser session.
- **Local Storage**: The extension uses Chrome’s `storage` API to save user preferences (e.g., enabling/disabling notifications or hiding slash commands) locally on your device. This data is not shared or transmitted.
- **Notifications**: If enabled, the extension displays OS notifications for chat mentions, using data from the Elvanto Live page (e.g., sender name, message). Notifications are generated locally and not sent to external servers.
- **XML Configuration**: The extension fetches open-source XML files from GitHub (https://nathan31973.github.io/Elvanto-Plus-Plus-Assets/*) to configure kill switches (e.g., disabling features if bugs occur) and church-specific permissions (e.g., enabling chat commands). These files are processed locally, and no user data is sent to GitHub or elsewhere.

## Permissions Explained

To provide its features, the extension requires the following permissions:

- **Scripting**: Allows injecting JavaScript and CSS to add buttons, timestamps, and styles to Elvanto Live pages.
- **ActiveTab**: Enables temporary access to the current tab for user-initiated enhancements, limited to Elvanto pages.
- **Notifications**: Permits displaying OS notifications for chat mentions, only when enabled by the user.
- **Storage**: Saves user preferences (e.g., notification settings) locally using Chrome’s storage API.
- **Host Permissions (https://*.elvanto.com.au/, https://nathan31973.github.io/Elvanto-Plus-Plus-Assets/)**: Allows the extension to modify Elvanto Live and roster pages and fetch XML configuration files from GitHub. No data is sent to these servers.

## Third-Party Services

- **GitHub**: The extension fetches open-source XML files from GitHub to configure features. These files are publicly accessible and do not contain or process personal data. No user data is transmitted to GitHub.
- **Elvanto Live**: The extension interacts with Elvanto Live pages but does not collect or transmit data to or from the Elvanto platform beyond what is displayed in the browser.

## Data Security

Since no personal data is collected or transmitted, there is no risk of data breaches from the extension. All processing (e.g., XML parsing, preference storage) occurs locally, and fetched XML files are read-only configuration data.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the extension’s functionality or legal requirements. Updates will be posted in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/nathan31973/elvanto-plus-plus). Please check periodically for changes.
